# 🏛️ MASTERY — Development Process Framework (Compact)

> **A universal, tech-agnostic framework for building software with discipline.**
> Every feature starts as a discussion, gets designed, becomes a plan, and ships as clean, tested code.
> Works for any project. Any language. Any stack. Any team size. Human or AI-driven.
>
> ⚠️ **THIS FILE IS READ-ONLY** in every project that uses this framework. Project-specific decisions belong in `project-context.md`. Feature-specific decisions belong in feature docs. Process customizations go in `docs/references/process-overrides.md`.
>
> 📦 **This is the compact variant** — optimized for AI agent context loading (~6k tokens vs ~25k). Contains all framework rules, lifecycle stages, and conventions. **Templates are NOT included** — load specific templates from the full `mastery.md` when creating new documents.

## 💡 Philosophy

1. **Think before you type.** No code until the discussion is complete.
2. **Design before you build.** Architecture decisions are documented, not improvised.
3. **Plan before you execute.** Every task is written down and checkable.
4. **Test before you ship.** Every feature has a test plan.
5. **Document as you go.** Changes are logged, not remembered.
6. **Review when you're done.** Reflect, learn, improve.
7. **Never edit the framework in consuming projects.** The `docs/mastery.md` copy is read-only.

Mastery makes the process as important as the product — whether the builder is human, AI, or both.

---

## 🤖 AI Agent Protocol

This section defines how AI agents (copilots, coding assistants, autonomous agents) should interact with this framework. Every AI agent working on a project using Mastery MUST follow these rules.

### Context Loading Order

When an AI agent starts a session on this project, it MUST read documents in this exact order:

```
1. docs/mastery-compact.md      → Framework rules (this file — compact, no templates)
2. docs/project-discussion.md   → Understand WHY the project exists and key decisions
3. docs/project-context.md      → Understand WHAT the project is (formalized)
4. docs/project-roadmap.md      → Understand WHERE the project stands
5. docs/features/ (active)      → Understand the current feature state
```

**Rule**: Never write code until you have read at minimum `project-context.md` and `project-roadmap.md`. Read `project-discussion.md` when you need deeper context on WHY decisions were made.

> ⚠️ **Every new context**: AI agents MUST re-read `docs/mastery-compact.md` at the start of every new context window or session — not just the first one. The framework rules, autonomy boundaries, and verification requirements must be fresh in context before any work begins.

> 📝 **Need a document template?** Load the specific template from `docs/mastery.md` — search for the heading (e.g., "### 4. Discussion Document"). Do NOT load the full file for rules — use this compact variant.

### Determining Current State

To figure out what's in progress:

1. Check `project-roadmap.md` — look for features marked 🟡 IN PROGRESS
2. Open that feature's docs in order: `discussion → architecture → tasks → changelog`
3. In the tasks doc, find the last checked checkbox — that's where work stopped
4. In the changelog doc, read the most recent entries — that's what happened last
5. Check the git branch — `git log --oneline -10` on the feature branch shows recent commits

### Autonomy Boundaries

AI agents MUST follow these rules about what they can and cannot do independently:

| Action | AI Can Do Autonomously? | Requires Human Approval |
|---|---|---|
| Read any project document | ✅ Yes | — |
| Write code within an active task | ✅ Yes | — |
| Check off completed tasks | ✅ Yes | — |
| Log entries in changelog | ✅ Yes | — |
| Create commits on feature branch | ✅ Yes | — |
| Push to feature branch | ✅ Yes | — |
| Update project changelog | ✅ Yes | — |
| Create a new feature's discussion doc | ✅ Yes | — |
| Modify architecture after finalization | ❌ No | ✅ Must discuss first |
| Skip any lifecycle stage | ❌ No | ✅ Never — no exceptions |
| Merge to main | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Delete any branch | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Delete or overwrite existing docs | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Change project-context.md | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Reorder features in roadmap | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Add new dependencies/packages | ❌ No | ✅ Always human-approved |
| Edit docs/mastery.md | ❌ No | ✅ Never — the project copy is read-only, no exceptions |
| Perform verification cross-check | ✅ Yes | — |
| Skip a required cross-check | ❌ No | ✅ Never — no exceptions |

### Verification Cross-Checks

AI agents MUST verify their work against planning docs — not just check that tests pass. A cross-check is a structured self-audit that catches drift between what was planned and what was built.

#### When to Cross-Check

| Trigger | What to Verify |
|---|---|
| After planning docs created | Discussion ↔ architecture ↔ tasks ↔ testplan alignment |
| Every ~5 build tasks completed | Code matches architecture, tasks checked off, changelog current |
| Before requesting merge | Full cross-check — all items below |

#### What to Verify

1. **Architecture ↔ Code** — Does the implementation match the architecture doc? Are deviations documented?
2. **Tasks ↔ Code** — Are completed tasks reflected in code? Are checkboxes updated?
3. **Testplan ↔ Tests** — Do testplan cases have corresponding tests? Are statuses filled in?
4. **Changelog ↔ Session** — Does the changelog reflect what happened this session?
5. **Dependencies ↔ Architecture** — Are only approved dependencies used?

#### Handling Gaps

- Fix gaps autonomously — update checkboxes, fill testplan statuses, log deviations
- Log the cross-check in the changelog: "Cross-check performed: N gaps found, N fixed"
- Escalate to human for architectural deviations or blocking issues

### MCP-Enhanced Workflow

If an MCP server is configured for a Mastery project, AI agents can use structured tool calls as an alternative to reading raw files. MCP is **optional** — the file-based workflow in Context Loading Order remains fully functional without it.

| Task | Without MCP | With MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Load project context | Read markdown files in order | Call status/overview tools for structured data |
| Find active feature | Parse roadmap for 🟡 markers | Call roadmap tool for parsed feature list |
| Check task progress | Read task file, count checkboxes | Call task tool for structured status |
| Search across docs | Grep through files | Call search tools with queries |

**Guidance**: Prefer MCP tools for status overviews and navigation. Always verify against raw docs when making changes — the files are the source of truth, not the MCP responses.

### Session Handoff Protocol

When ending a session (human-to-AI, AI-to-human, or AI-to-AI), the outgoing party MUST:

1. **Update the changelog** — log what was done in this session
2. **Update task checkboxes** — mark completed items, note partial progress
3. **Leave a "Session Note"** at the top of the changelog:

```markdown
### Session Note — YYYY-MM-DD
- **Who**: [Human / AI Agent Name]
- **Duration**: [Approximate time or "async"]
- **Worked On**: [Brief description]
- **Stopped At**: [Exact task ID, e.g., "B.3 — halfway through validation logic"]
- **Blockers**: [Any issues preventing progress, or "None"]
- **Next Steps**: [What the next session should pick up]
```

### AI Communication Style

When an AI agent is working within this framework:
- **Ask before assuming** — if a requirement is ambiguous, ask. Don't guess.
- **Reference docs** — when making decisions, cite which doc informed the choice.
- **Explain deviations** — if you deviate from the architecture or tasks, log WHY in the changelog before proceeding.
- **Never silently skip** — if a step seems unnecessary, say so and get confirmation. Don't just skip it.
- **Ask about testing** — if a `testplan.md` exists for the active feature, ask the developer if they want test auditing (TC coverage check) during the build stage. Don't assume.

## 🚀 Project Initialization

When starting a new project with Mastery, the very first thing you do is **discuss the project**.

1. **Set Up Docs Skeleton** — Create `docs/` with `mastery.md`, `mastery-compact.md`, `project-discussion.md`, `features/`, `references/`
2. **Discuss the Project** — Create `project-discussion.md`, have a thorough conversation covering: what, why, who, tech stack, architecture, constraints, features, definition of done. Mark COMPLETE when decided.
3. **Create Project Context** — Distill discussion into `project-context.md` (single source of truth)
4. **Generate AGENTS.md** — Create at project root using Template #12 (see full `mastery.md`). Derived from `project-context.md`.
5. **Build the Roadmap** — Create `project-roadmap.md`: list features, order by dependency, assign sequence numbers
6. **Create Project Changelog** — Create `project-changelog.md` with empty `[Unreleased]` section
7. **Start Feature 01** — Follow the Feature Lifecycle below

```
┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│   1. DISCUSS     │    │  2. FORMALIZE    │    │   3. PLAN        │    │  4. BUILD    │
│   the project    │───▶│  project-context │───▶│  project-roadmap │───▶│  Feature 01  │
└──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────────────┘

## 🔄 The Workflow — Feature Lifecycle

Every feature flows through **6 stages** with clear entry/exit conditions.

```
  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
  │ 1.DISCUSS│─▶│ 2.DESIGN │─▶│ 3.PLAN   │─▶│ 4.BUILD  │─▶│ 5.SHIP   │─▶│ 6.REFLECT│
  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘
   discussion    architecture   tasks         changelog     review        review
   doc           doc            + testplan     updated       doc           completed
                                + api (opt)
```

### Stage 1 — Discuss 💬

> **Entry**: Feature in roadmap → **Exit**: Discussion doc marked COMPLETE

Create `discussion.md`. Define requirements, current state, approach, edge cases, dependencies. If knowledge gaps exist, research before proceeding — document findings in the discussion doc or a separate `research.md`. Update iteratively until confident. Mark COMPLETE.

### Stage 2 — Design 🏗️

> **Entry**: Discussion COMPLETE → **Exit**: Architecture doc FINALIZED

Create `architecture.md`. Define file structure, data models, component design, data flow, trade-offs, config changes.

### Stage 3 — Plan 📋

> **Entry**: Architecture FINALIZED → **Exit**: Tasks + testplan + api (if needed) created

Create `tasks.md` with phased checklist (adapt phases to project type — always end with Testing + Docs phases). Create `testplan.md` with acceptance criteria and test cases. Create `api.md` if feature has external interfaces. Create `changelog.md` (empty). Create feature branch.

#### Phase Organization Guidance

| Project Type | Suggested Phases |
|---|---|
| **Web Application** | Data Layer → Business Logic → HTTP/API → UI → Testing → Docs |
| **CLI Tool** | Core Logic → Command Parsing → I/O → Error Handling → Testing → Docs |
| **Library/SDK** | Core API → Internal Utilities → Public Interface → Testing → Docs |
| **Data Pipeline** | Ingestion → Transformation → Validation → Output → Testing → Docs |
| **Mobile App** | Data/State → Core Logic → UI Components → Navigation → Testing → Docs |

### Stage 4 — Build 🔨

> **Entry**: Branch created, planning docs done → **Exit**: All tasks checked, all tests pass

Execute tasks phase by phase, check off items, log changes in changelog, add session notes, commit frequently, run tests at checkpoints, push to feature branch.

### Stage 5 — Ship 🚀

> **Entry**: All tasks complete, all tests pass → **Exit**: Merged to main (human-approved)

Self-review diffs. Final test pass. Human approval. Merge to main. Update `project-changelog.md`. Push main. **Keep the feature branch** (never delete).

### Stage 6 — Reflect 🪞

> **Entry**: Feature merged → **Exit**: Review doc completed

Create `review.md`. Document what went well, what went wrong, what was learned. Update roadmap (mark feature 🟢 Complete).

---

## 🪶 Lightweight Feature Variant

For **planned trivial** changes (docs-only, config-only, no architecture decisions). A single `lightweight.md` replaces all six standard docs.

### Eligibility (ALL must be true)

1. No new code logic
2. No architectural decisions
3. Well-understood scope (few sentences)
4. Low risk
5. Self-contained

If **any** criterion is not met, use the full lifecycle.

### Rules

- Still uses feature branches — no direct commits to main
- Still requires human approval for merge
- Feature branches never deleted
- If scope grows, upgrade to full lifecycle (lightweight.md becomes discussion.md)

---

## 📛 Document Naming Convention

| Element | Format | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature folder** | `XX-feature-name` | `01-project-setup`, `02-auth-system` |
| **Doc filenames** | Simple type name | `discussion.md`, `architecture.md`, `tasks.md` |
| **Branch name** | `feature/XX-feature-name` | `feature/02-auth-system` |

Features numbered in **dependency order** defined in `project-roadmap.md`.

---

## 🌿 Git Branching Strategy

```
main ─────●────●────●────●──────▶
           \       ↗  \       ↗
            ●─●─●─●    ●─●─●─●
           feature/     feature/
           01-name      02-name
           (kept)       (kept)
```

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **main** | Always deployable. Only receives merges. |
| **feature/XX-name** | Created from latest `main`. One per feature. |
| **hotfix/description** | Created from latest `main`. Critical fixes only. |
| **Never delete** | All branches kept forever. |

```bash
# Start feature          # Merge feature (human-approved)
git checkout main         git checkout main
git pull origin main      git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/  git merge feature/XX-name
  XX-feature-name         git push origin main
```

---

## ✍️ Commit Message Convention

```
type(scope): short description
```

| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace — no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructure — no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build, config, tooling, dependencies |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `hotfix` | Critical production fix |

Scope = feature name or module (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `docs`).

## 🔁 Resuming Work

### For AI Agents

1. Read `docs/mastery-compact.md` — reload framework rules (mandatory every session)
2. Read `docs/project-context.md` — refresh on what this project is
3. Read `docs/project-roadmap.md` — find the 🟡 IN PROGRESS feature
4. Read that feature's `changelog.md` — latest Session Note
5. Read that feature's `tasks.md` — find last checked checkbox
6. Continue from the exact task where work stopped
7. Add a new Session Note to the changelog when you start

### For Humans

1. Check `project-roadmap.md` for current status
2. Open active feature's `tasks.md` and `changelog.md`
3. If an AI was working, review its commits: `git log --oneline -20`
4. Continue from where things left off
